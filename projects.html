              This project collects and tracks the addition or consumption of
              registered food products by its RF ID presence and measures its
              weight. The website has a login and sign-up page which a user can
              sign into and track or add IoT devices. The users IoT data is
              displayed in a tabular format to the logged in user. An SQLite db
              is used to store user and sensor information. Passwords are not
              hashed and saved as plaintext per user. Users' session ID is
              stored and updated on the db per login to maintain ease of login.
              IoT data is sent to API endpoints created on the deployed web app
              on a flask server.
